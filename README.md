# Filler
The task was to create a player program to compete against other students on Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed.
